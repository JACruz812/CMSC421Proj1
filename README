This project is a simple C shell that implements system executables and built ins(setenv,getenv,exit)

In order to accept an arbitrary input I had to create a char* that reallocated as it reach a maximum buf count

I used main arguement count to ensure that none were passed in start up

I parsed the input using strtok to tokenize and parse out each arguement

I used execvp,fork, and pid type vars to create child processes for system executables

I used the predefined exit,getenv and setenv funcs along with conditionals to implement built ins
